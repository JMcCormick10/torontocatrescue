# The Toronto Cat Rescue Adoption Page

## Description

The Purpose of this plugin is to streamline the adoption process for Toronto Cat Rescue.
First; It allows available cats to viewed directly on there primary site by pulling all the cats they have listed for adoption from [petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/). The plugin pulls directly from Petfinders API, then formats the information and pictures to offer site visitors a user friendly; aesthetically pleasing, viewing experience that matches Toronto Cat Rescues site. The moment Toronto Cat Rescue lists a new cat on Petfinder it is listed on their site.
Second; it allows adopters to apply directly for adoption on the site. The adoption form can now be completed and signed online by clicking the “Apply to Adopt” button the plugin adds to each profile. This greatly reduces the number of steps required to complete the form and removes the need for printing and scanning.
Third; it houses all completed adoption forms on the backend of their site. Forms can no longer be lost, and do not need to be physically filed. This also allows the Adoption Manager to review forms the moment they are completed. Forms are held on the backend of their main site indefinitely and can be accessed at anytime for review.

Phase 2:
* Future additions that could be added to the plugin.
* Add an Online Payment feature.
* Add the “Ask About Me” button/form from pet finder.
* General Tidying and clean up on the code.
